# Data Collection
The World Happiness Report datasets are based on data from the Gallup World Poll, a global survey conducted by the Gallup organization. The survey involves asking individuals to rate their happiness on a scale known as the Cantril ladder, where 0 represe nts the worst possible life and 10 represents the best possible life. The datasets include variables such as happiness scores, GDP per capita, family, health life expectancy, freedom, trust government corruption, and generosity. The data collection method involves administering surveys to individuals across various countries.

# Contents
The datasets consist of five separate files corresponding to the World Happiness Reports from 2015 to 2019. Each file contains similar variables related to happiness scores, country information, and factors influencing happiness. These variables include c ountry, region (present in some years), happiness rank, happiness score, GDP per capita, family, health life expectancy, freedom, trust government corruption, generosity, as well as additional variables such as standard error, confidence intervals, and whiskers.

# Data Relevance
The World Happiness Report datasets are relevant for various reasons. They provide valuable insights into factors influencing happiness within countries, allowing for comparisons between countries and regions to identify trends and patterns in happiness levels over time.

# Data Limitations
There are several limitations to consider when using the World Happiness Report datasets. Firstly, happiness is a subjective measure influenced by cultural, societal, and individual differences, which may not be fully captured in the data. Data accuracy may be affected by the survey based nature of the data collection process. Bias could potentially be introduced, as not all countries may have comprehensive data available for all factors included in the report. Lastly, the time comprehensive data available for all factors included in the report. Lastly, the time frame of the data is limited, as the most recent report is a fiframe of the data is limited, as the most recent report is five years old.

# Key Questions:

- What is the relationship between GDP growth rate and changes in happiness scores over time?
- Does access to healthcare services and infrastructure impact a country's happiness?
- Is there a relationship between educational attainment levels and happiness scores across different nations?across different nations?
